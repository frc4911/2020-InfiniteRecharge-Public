Driver for the STMicroelectronics VL53L0X Sensor
---
The VL53L0X class provides an interface to some of the range-finding capabilities of the STMicroelectronics VL53L0X sensor. It uses I2C communications to interface to the RoboRIO.
 
The VL53L0X is a laser-ranging sensor, which measures the range to a target an 
object up to 2 m away. It uses time-of-flight measurements of infrared pulses for ranging,
allowing it to give accurate results independent of the targetâ€™s color and surface.
